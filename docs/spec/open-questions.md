# Open Questions

1. Should we deprecate legacy plugin key `mkdocs-export` in v1 and keep only `docflux-mkdocs`?
2. PDF default: keep Pandoc/LaTeX default or prioritize browser-rendered PDF engine?
3. Single-file mode only for v1, or include per-section outputs?
4. Minimum supported Python and MkDocs versions?
5. Distribution workflow: PyPI-only first, or also Homebrew/packaging docs?
6. Should non-nav pages be excluded by default from exports?
7. Should default PDF page size be A4 or Letter when no CSS is provided?
8. Should Mermaid render failures warn-and-continue (current default) or fail fast?
